# TI mmWave ROS Package (Customized)

#### Based on updates from Dr. Leo Zhang (University of Arizona)
---
### Most recent change from Dr. Zhang:
Add support for XWR18XX devices. SDK version: 3.2.0.4.

### Most recent change from Allison Wendell:
Add support for XWR68XX devices. SDK version: 3.2.0.4

---
Initially derived from TI's origin ROS package in Industrial Toolbox 2.3.0 (new version available [Industrial Toolbox 2.5.2](http://dev.ti.com/tirex/#/?link=Software%2FmmWave%20Sensors%2FIndustrial%20Toolbox)).

### Differences from origin TI's version:
1. Added all radar parameters from calculations and can be read from `rosparam get`.
2. Added Doppler data from detecting targets and form a customized ROS message `/ti_mmwave/radar_scan`.
3. Added support for multiple radars working together.
4. Added support for camera overlay (for sensor fusion).
5. Working with xWR1443 and xWR1642 ES1.0 and ES2.0 (ES1.0 is deprecated from TI)
---
### Available devices:
```
TI mmWave xWR1443BOOST
TI mmWave xWR1642BOOST
TI mmWave xWR1642BOOST ES2.0/3.0 EVM (not tested)
TI mmWave xWR1642BOOST ES2.0 EVM
TI mmWave AWR1843BOOST ES1.0 EVM
TI mmWave IWR6843ISK ES1.0 EVM
```
---
### Quick start guide (AWR1642BOOST ES2.0 EVM):
1. Mount AWR1642BOOST ES2.0 EVM (as below), connect 5V/2.5A power supply and connect a micro-USB cable to host Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic).

Note: Tested with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with ROS Kinectic and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic)

2. Download SDK 2.0 or above (suggested SDK 2.1) from [here](http://www.ti.com/tool/MMWAVE-SDK) and use [UNIFLASH](http://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH) to flash xwr16xx_mmw_demo.bin to your device. **Do not forget SOP2 jumper when flashing.**

3. Clone this repo and ROS serial onto your `<workspace dir>/src`:

```
git clone https://github.com/wjwwood/serial.git
git clone https://bitbucket.itg.ti.com/scm/mmwave_apps/ros_multisensor_demo.git
```
4. Go back to `<workspace dir>`:

```
catkin_make && source devel/setup.bash
echo "source <workspace_dir>/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

5. Enable command and data ports on Linux:
```
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM1
```
Note: If multiple sensors are used, enable additional ports `/dev/ttyACM2` and `/dev/ttyACM3`, etc. the same as this step.

6. Launch AWR1642 short range config:
```
roslaunch ti_mmwave_rospkg 1642es2_short_range.launch
```

Note: If you want to build your own config, use [mmWave Demo Visualizer](https://dev.ti.com/mmwavedemovisualizer) and link the launch file to the config.

7. ROS topics can be accessed as follows:
```
rostopic list
rostopic echo /ti_mmwave/radar_scan
```
8. ROS parameters can be accessed as follows:
```
rosparam list
rosparam get /ti_mmwave/max_doppler_vel
```

### Troubleshooting
1.
```
mmWaveCommSrv: Failed to open User serial port with error: IO Exception (13): Permission denied
mmWaveCommSrv: Waiting 20 seconds before trying again...
```
This happens when serial port is called without superuser permission, do the following steps:
```
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM1
```
2.
```
mmWaveQuickConfig: Command failed (mmWave sensor did not respond with 'Done')
mmWaveQuickConfig: Response: 'sensorStop
'?`????`????`???~' is not recognized as a CLI command
mmwDemo:/>'
```
When this happens, re-run the command you send to sensor. If it continues, shut down and restart the sensor.

---
### Multiple devices support (dual AWR1642 ES2.0 EVM):
1. Connect two devices and try `ll /dev/serial/by-id` or `ls /dev`. In this case, `/dev/ttyACM0` to `/dev/ttyACM3` should shown.
2. To avoid serial port confliction, you need to launch devices separately. So for first device (it will open rviz):

```
roslaunch ti_mmwave_rospkg multi_1642_0.launch 
```
3. Change radars' location in first six arguments `<node pkg="tf" type="static_transform_publisher" name="radar_baselink_0" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 ti_mmwave_pcl ti_mmwave_0 100"/>` (stands for x,y,z for positions in meters and yaw, pitch, roll for angles in radians) in launch file `multi_1642_1.launch`. And launch second device:

```
roslaunch ti_mmwave_rospkg multi_1642_1.launch 
```

Note: As serial connection and the original code, you need to launch devices separately using different launch files.

---
### Camera overlay support (working with USB camera or CV camera):
1. Download and build USB camera repo [here](https://github.com/radar-lab/usb_webcam`). And set parameters of camera in `<usb_webcam dir>/launch/usb_webcam.launch`.
2. To test the device image working, try:
```
roslaunch usb_webcam usb_webcam.launch
rosrun rqt_image_view rqt_image_view  
```
3. Make sure you have done [ROS camera calibration](http://wiki.ros.org/camera_calibration) and create a `*.yaml` configuration file accordingly.
4. Launch radar-camera system using:
```
roslaunch ti_mmwave_rospkg camera_overlay.launch
```
